    <h1>Diffrence between var, let, const</h1>
    <div>
        var:
        Scope: Function-scoped. Variables declared with var are function-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the function they are declared in.
    </div>
    <div>
        let:
        Scope: Block-scoped. Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) they are declared in.
    </div>
    <div>
        const:
        Scope: Block-scoped. Similar to let, variables declared with const are block-scoped.
    </div>
